	    	<p>Designing interactive systems for people with mobility impairments presents unique challenges for Human Computer Interaction. Complex individual differences make it difficult to develop a single solution that will be suitable for every user. In addition to functional requirements, there are also social factors that impact the use of technology such as the stigma associated with assistive adaptations.
			</p>
			<p>My research has explored the application of wearable and ubiquitous computing concepts for wheelchair-based systems. The overall goal is to support usersâ€™ interaction with information technology through more natural and intuitive user interfaces. This work has implications for the design of future assistive technology systems, as well as more general applications for wearable and ubiquitous computing technology. In my research I have been designing mobile and wearable interactive systems for power wheelchair users, which we call Chairables.
